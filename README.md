# Internship Projects: Travel Buddy & Automated Patient Registration
## Project 1: Travel Buddy

### Abstract
Travel Buddy automates the travel planning process using UiPath. It fetches travel details, books flights and hotels, and provides itinerary suggestions based on user inputs.

### Problem Statement
To build an automated travel assistant that organizes trip planning by retrieving and presenting travel-related options using UiPath.

### Objectives
- Automate flight and hotel booking
- Personalize travel suggestions
- Integrate maps and GPS functionality
- Reduce manual efforts with reminders and notifications

### Implementation Steps
1. Start a UiPath project named “Travel Buddy”
2. Collect user preferences using `Input Dialog`
3. Use `Open Browser` to launch travel sites (e.g., MakeMyTrip)
4. Automate data input using `Type Into` and `Click`
5. Extract information using `Get Text` or `Data Scraping`
6. Display travel recommendations
7. Handle errors using `Try Catch` blocks
8. Use `Attach Window` for multi-page navigation

### Result
An automated workflow that assists users in efficiently planning trips, reduces manual work, and increases travel booking speed and convenience.

## Project 2: Automated Patient Registration

### Abstract
This project automates the hospital patient registration process using UiPath by filling forms, validating data, checking for duplicates, and exporting to Excel.

### Problem Statement
To streamline patient onboarding and reduce errors by automating the data entry process using RPA.

### Objectives
- Automate login and navigation to the hospital portal
- Read patient details from Excel
- Fill and submit registration forms
- Validate data and check for duplicates
- Export registered data to Excel

### Implementation Steps
1. Create a new UiPath project for patient registration
2. Read patient data using `Read Range`
3. Open hospital system via `Use Application/Browser`
4. Fill form fields using `Type Into` and loop through data
5. Submit forms and capture confirmation
6. Save confirmation to Excel using `Write Cell`
7. Use modular workflows for reusability
8. Add robust `Try Catch` blocks for reliability

### Result
Improved accuracy and reduced administrative workload in hospitals through automation of patient registration.
